# README - video 34 - MicroPython LVGL 9 - An interesting program

# Topic 20 May 2025
This is video 34 on MicroPython and LVGL. This is the first video of a two part miniseries on the LVGL MicroPython pioneering efforts These efforts are being developed on ESP32, but are destined for many platforms like the RPI Pico.  In this video, we use a newly built firmware for an ESP32-S3 board to introduce LVGL 9.3 - MicroPython on the ESP32. We discuss wiring and setup. Then we demonstrate the setup using two previous examples.

The hardware, mounted on a breadboard, is the WeAct Studios ESP32-S3-Oct (N16R8) USB board and a standard ILI9341 display.

In this video,
    • Present firmware, wiring and setup changes
    • Demonstrate using two previous example
    • Provide impressions
